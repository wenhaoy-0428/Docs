# Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler for `JS` and `JS` only, there are also loaders play like plugins to allow it work with `css`, `scss` files. 

What Webpack does is bundle multiple JS modules into a single `main.js`(the name is improvised here). Thus, in development, we can have human-readable organization of our code layout, and a single, linted JS file for publication. 

Webpack offers similar job as `Parcel` and it's internally included in React.
