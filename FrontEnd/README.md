# Main Workflow

1. Use JS framework, like React to utilize its component features to build the web application

2. Use SCSS to create CSS or use Postcss directly for nesting and TailWind for framework if needed.

3. Use module bundlers (Webpack, Parcel) to build all files(modules) into single, compact production files. 

4. Deploy.

> module bundlers are normally included in a framework. And JS test framework like Jest should also be considered using.

# Technologies

## [Webpack](./Webpack/webpackNotes.md)

Webpack is a module bundler for `JS` and `JS` only, there are also loaders play like plugins to allow it work with `css`, `scss` files. 

## SCSS

SCSS is a CSS preprocessor that allows easier CSS variables and CSS nesting.

## Postcss 

Postcss is a post-processor that mainly serves as a tool to add fallback properties to support browser compatibility. However, it also serves the functionality a preprocessor does.

## [TailWind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr15Xzb1Ook)

This is a CSS framework that includes a bunch of classes that you can use.
