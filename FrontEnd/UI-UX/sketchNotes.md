# Sketch

Sketch is a software tool that allows you to design the layout and how your app is should looked like, like drawing a blueprint by pencil. Sketch gives your more, it allows interactions to give you a more vivid view how you app is going to work, and the logics. 

For UI/UX designer, this `Sketch` and `Adobe XD`, `Figma` are such tools that they will use to deliver the the look of your app to the front-end developer who will truly implement the code according to the design.



## ArtBoard

An ArtBoard is a canvas on which you have all your components(`layout` in Sketch). There're predefined ones that have the same dimensions as real hardwares. 

## Symbol

Symbols are just reusable components(`layout` in Sketch). When dealing the same component in many views (`ArtBoard` in Sketch), making it a `symbol` will save a lot of work, and changes in the `symbol` itself will propagate to all instances. Also, you can `detach` the symbol in specific view where view will own the symbol as private component and propagations are immune.


## Group

```
cmd + G
```

When selecting several components, grouping them allows you to treat them as a single component. This is always a good approach to create groups.


## platter

The good approach of designing a component is to have a triangle as the platter, which is the `container` in development. And have all other components on top of it.
