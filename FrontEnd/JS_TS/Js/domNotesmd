# [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)

## Intro

DOM (Document Object Model) is a browser web API that enables us to interact with the browser to change the content dynamically.

Internally, **it's a tree based on the HTML** layout. And everything therefore is a `node`. 

Refer to [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#the_document_object_model) to have a look at rendered tree.

**Each element is a node, and text are classified as `textNode`**
```js
const text = document.createTextNode(' â€” the premier source for web development knowledge.');
linkPara.appendChild(text);
```

There're several ways to select an element: `document.querySelector()`, `document.getElementById()` .. In the modern application, use `document.querySelector()` as it enables CSS selector, and can be used to select element by `Id`, `tagName` which is much more succinct than having them in each specific function.

## Moving/Removing Elements

We use [Node.appendChild(ele)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) to add or move elements. When the provided `ele` is a reference to an existing element, this function will move it. 

> Note Js treats variables as references, instead of copies. When you truly wish to copy an element use [Node.cloneNode()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode)
