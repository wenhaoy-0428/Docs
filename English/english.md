## Bane
> This triple heritage is both a blessing and a **bane**.

*C++ Primer Plus 09-01*

## Jargon
> The rest of the book teaches you to use the C++ language, going from the modest basics of the language to the glory of object-oriented programming and its supporting **cast of new jargon** -- objects, encapsulation, data hiding, polymorphism, and inheritance. 

*C++ Primer Plus 09-02*

## Avail .. of
> One reason to use C++ is to **avail** yourself **of** its object-oriented features.

*C++ Primer Plus 10-01*

## Sound background
> To do so, you need a **sound background** in standard C.

*C++ Primer Plus 10-02*

## Poised
> So if you already know C, you're **poised** to learn C++.

*C++ Primer Plus 10-03*

## Mind-stretching
> If you are beginning to think that learning C++ may involve some **mind-stretching** effort on your part, you're right.

*C++ Primer Plus 10-04*

## Every nook and cranny
> This book is not intended to be a complete C++ reference; it doesn't explore **every nook and cranny** of the language.

*C++ Primer Plus 10-05*

## Usher in an era
> In the 1970s, languages such as C and PAscal helped **usher in an era** of structured programming.

*C++ Primer Plus 10-06*

## As if
> It was a bit **as if** each time you bought a new car, you found that the designers decided to change where the controls went and what they did, forcing you to relearn how to drive.

*C++ Primer Plus 11-01*

## Graft
> Because C++ **grafts** a new programming philosophy onto C, we should first take a look at the older philosophy that C follows.

*C++ Primer Plus 11-02*

## Brevity
> Stroustrup based C+++ on C because of C's **brevity**, its suitability to system programming, its widespread availability, and its close ties to the Unix operating system.

*C++ Primer Plus 15-02*

## Discrepancy
> C++ is a superset of C, meaning that any valid C program is a valid C++ program, too. There are some minor **discrepancies** but nothing crucial.

*C++ Primer Plus 15-03*

## Without a hitch
> If you can recompile the program without making changes and it runs **without a hitch**, we say the program is portable.

*C++ Primer Plus 15-04*

## Dub
> C++ continues to evolve, and the ISO committee approved a new standard August 2011 titled ISO/IEC 14882:2011 and informally **dubbed** C++11.
