# Web

For WebApplications, we have **WebGL** which stands for Web graphic library that allows us to draw on a `canvas` element inside html without any external plug-ins. `WebGL` specifies a ton of APIs allowing us not only to draw 2D graphic, but 3D, all powered by GPU.

To abstract away the complexity of WebGL, one of the Most popular library to draw 3D graphics is [three.js](https://threejs.org). 


## Three.js

Three.js gives us the functionality to set a 3D scene with camera, model, lighting and etc inside a `canvas`. A quick demonstration of using three.js to create a 3D web can be found at these videos [Build a Mindblowing 3D Portfolio Website // Three.js Beginnerâ€™s Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU) and [Three.js Crash Course For Beginners | Create This Awesome 3D Website!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OwJV2xL8M8).


### Integrate Three.js into React

3JS is a JS library, which follows the js syntax and has no idea how React works. 

Commonly, to use 3JS in a React component way, [react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) is used to abstract. 

Also, three.js can be used directly by React app using JS without any middleware, and a setup tutorial to help organize can be found at [How to use plain Three.js in your React apps](https://itnext.io/how-to-use-plain-three-js-in-your-react-apps-417a79d926e0)
