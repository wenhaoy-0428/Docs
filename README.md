Hello, my amazing friend.


# [HTML && CSS](./FrontEnd/HTML_CSS/_sidebar.md)
> Both HTML and CSS can give a fundamental understanding of Web basics. I recommend skimming through HTML knowing the basic structure is good enough and **spend more effort on CSS**. Especially, `Flex` of CSS, which will be used heavily in later project.

# [JavaScript](./FrontEnd/Js/jsNotes.md)
> JS is a weird language, there are some of the main quirks you should get yourself familiar with. 1. `Object`, 2. `Function` (normal & arrow function) 3. `Difference between Class and function`, 4. `this` keyword.

# [TypeScript](./BackEnd/TypeScript/tsNotes.md)
> With some basic understanding of JS, Ts should be a small cake. But pay attention to `type union`, `type vs interface`

# [React](./FrontEnd/React/_sidebar.md)
> Inside section, fundamentals of react is included covering JSX. This notes so far, only covers React, not [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code). However, the fundamentals are the same.
