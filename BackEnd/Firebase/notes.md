# Firebase

Firebase is an extension of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where GCP is a platform as a service provider, that provides many products, including VMs and storages. A quick walkthrough of all the products that GCP provides can be found at [GCP Products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzwSBbuHY-0).

Firebase is built upon GCP and fusions the GCP products together to provide backend support, therefore firebase is also known as Backend as a service (BAAS). It provides hosting, and storage with little configurations.
